    "\n",
    "3. You could design another assignment as an extra credit and all students will have equal opportunity.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Have the student who did not complete the assignment evaluate another student's or group's submission and suggest improvements on their code.\n",

    "5. Suggest a small topic to present on such as git version control, compare anaconda vs ux for environment control, etc. This will need to be a small project though so that it is fair for that student to not overwork."
